# Always Remember Solution

A has to be the answer for the first column and first row place, since the only starting character in the OR expression that matches a character inside the `[NOTAD]*` set is A. Following suit, the first column second row place would be W because we would need to match the the only OR case with an A of `AW`. 

We now can solve the remaining places in the second row, which are E and the L. This is because we already found out the W, and then only OR case that matches with the starting W would be `WEL`. 

T would be in the first row second column place since it is the only character that is repeating within the 2 sets: `[TUBE]` and `[NOTAD]`.

Finally, O is in both `[BORF]` and `[NOTAD]`, therefore taking up the first row and third column space. *** *side note: The L is allowed in the bottom left corner because of the dot in the full `[BORF]`. expression, indicating that it can be any character!*

So... Always remember *A TOWEL*! ðŸš¿
